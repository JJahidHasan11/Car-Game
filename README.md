# Car Game

## Project Description
We were assigned to create a Pygame implementation of the Car Racing game mainly using object-oriented programming approach. We chose to develop a "Cars" movie themed racing game.

## "Cars" Racing Game

The game is a Cars themed racing game, where the player controls Lightning McQueen on a racing track. The goal of the game is to race against a stream of other cars without crashing for as long as possible, accumulating points from the time played. The game contains different kinds of power ups that the player can get by driving into them. The game contains a special game mode where the player is able to shoot other cars. In the special game mode there are no power ups but there are bombs on the track that end the game if the player crashes into them. The game can also be played in multiplayer, where two players choose their cars colors and race on the same track. In multiplayer, the player that doesn't crash wins the race.
